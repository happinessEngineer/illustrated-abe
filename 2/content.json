    "story": "In a cozy corner of Caf\u00e9 Paris on Hamburg\u2019s Jungfernstieg, 68-year-old Greta Vogt tapped her pen against a half-drunk cappuccino. As a long-time court reporter at the Hanseatic Regional Court, she\u2019d spent the past fortnight chronicling a painfully violent trial\u2014and each night, the echoes of shouted testimony and frightened witnesses haunted her dreams.\n\nSitting across from her was Karl Neumann, also 68, a retired shipping-line manager who\u2019d known Greta since school. He noticed her usual spark had dimmed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been awfully quiet,\u201d he said, stirring his tea. \u201cIs the trial still weighing on you?\u201d\n\nGreta sighed. \u201cI find myself replaying those moments in my head\u2014every raised voice, every tear. I wake up tense, convinced I\u2019ll walk into court today as if nothing happened. I feel stuck in that heaviness.\u201d\n\nKarl leaned forward. \u201cRemember what you told me once: \u2018Emotions are like the Elbe\u2019s tides\u2014always arriving and then receding.\u2019 You know, negative feelings aren\u2019t permanent. They\u2019re just visitors.\u201d\n\nGreta closed her eyes. \u201cI know, in theory. But when I\u2019m in the middle of it, it feels endless.\u201d\n\nKarl smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s practice shifting your focus. Tell me three things you\u2019re grateful for right now.\u201d\n\nGreta thought for a moment. \u201cThe soft morning light dancing on the Alster. My dog, Maja, waiting at home for her walk. And the fact that I get to meet you for coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this exact moment,\u201d Karl continued gently, \u201cyour brain can\u2019t hold both the stress of the trial and the warmth of those good things. Choose which you feed.\u201d\n\nGreta opened her eyes and looked around. She noticed the wrought-iron railing of the caf\u00e9\u2019s balcony, the chatter of early-morning passersby, the sweet scent of freshly baked Franzbr\u00f6tchen. She pulled out a small notebook and began to jot down gratitude\u2014as Karl sipped his tea in companionable silence.\n\nFifteen minutes later, Greta set aside her pen with a small, genuine smile. \u201cI feel lighter,\u201d she said. \u201cNot because the trial vanished, but because I remembered I\u2019m more than my worries.\u201d\n\nKarl nodded. \u201cNegative emotions serve a purpose\u2014alerting us to what matters. But like Hamburg\u2019s April showers, they pass. Behind every cloud is your own bright horizon.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, Greta returned to her court transcripts with steadier hands. When the defense attorney\u2019s voice rose in anger, she jotted the words calmly. And at day\u2019s end, instead of dragging her grief home, she took Maja for a long walk along the Elbstrand, breathing in the salt air. \n\nBy evening, the trial\u2019s harsh images had retreated into the distance of her mind\u2014temporary ripples on a much wider sea. And Greta knew: even the heaviest emotions give way, over and over, to the possibility of something better."
