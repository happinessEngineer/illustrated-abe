    "story": "Under the warm glow of a setting sun, Layla wound her way through the bustling alleys of Marrakech\u2019s old medina. A laboratory technician by training, she\u2019d come here seeking a reset\u2014clean air, vibrant colors, and perhaps, a spark of romance. For weeks she\u2019d warned herself not to get her hopes up; past disappointments had taught her caution. As she crossed into the courtyard of a tadelakt workshop, she braced for polite indifference.\n\nInside, Youssef, a tour guide who\u2019d befriended her on her first day, waved. \u201cLayla, meet Omar,\u201d he said, gesturing toward a tall man shaping clay into delicate vases. His smile was calm, confident, and wholly unexpected. Layla realized she\u2019d been bracing for aloofness, and his warmth threw her off balance.\n\nOver mint tea later that evening, she told Omar about her work in the lab back home\u2014blood slides, precise measurements, the sterile hum of machines. He listened attentively, eyes bright. Every nod and encouraging word chipped away at her guarded wall. When she admitted she\u2019d told herself love in midlife was too late, he leaned forward. \u201cWe attract what we believe we deserve. What do you want to expect, Layla?\u201d\n\nHis question hovered, sweet as the tea\u2019s sugar. That night, she journaled under her tiled balcony, realizing she\u2019d cursed herself with doubt. The next morning, she strolled into the workshop expecting kindness, laughter, and genuine interest. To her delight, each expectation was met. Omar shared stories of his grandfather\u2019s pottery, running his hands over a finished bowl as if recalling an old friend. Layla found herself laughing more freely than she had in years.\n\nWeeks later, at Jardin Majorelle, they wandered past cobalt walls and towering palms. When Omar reached for her hand, she accepted it without hesitation. She\u2019d shifted her inner script from mistrust to welcome, and in return, life mirrored her openness. In the rose-scented dusk, Layla understood: the relationship she received was simply the one she\u2019d dared to expect.",
