    "story": "Maris slipped through the polished glass doors of Solaris Casino on a quiet street in Kadriorg, Tallinn, Harju County. She carried her sketchbook under one arm, restless and unsure how to bring her newest idea to life. The neon tables and ringing chips usually thrilled her friend Liis, a Casino Dealer whose steady hands and bright smile always put players at ease. Tonight, Maris wasn\u2019t here for games\u2014she\u2019d come searching for inspiration.\n\nLiis waved from behind a green felt roulette table. \u201cYou look distracted,\u201d she observed, stacking chips with practiced grace. \u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d\n\nMaris sank into a velvet chair. \u201cI want to finish a vision board\u2014my big life project\u2014but it feels\u2026 fuzzy. I can\u2019t see it clearly.\u201d\n\nLiis paused, glancing at the wheel\u2019s numbered pockets. \u201cVision clarifies vibration,\u201d she said softly, echoing a phrase she\u2019d learned from evening talks with her little sister. \u201cWhen you picture exactly what you want, you fine-tune your energy to match it. That\u2019s how you make things happen.\u201d\n\nIntrigued, Maris opened her sketchbook to a blank page. Liis pointed to the wheel. \u201cFirst, focus on one vivid detail\u2014a color, a feeling, a sound. Right now, listen to the click of the wheel stopping.\u201d The wheel spun, the ball clattered, then fell into pocket 22. \u201cThat\u2019s clarity in motion,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou want your vision to click into place the same way.\u201d\n\nMaris closed her eyes. She imagined curling brushstrokes in sapphire and emerald, the thrill of a gallery reveal, the glow of someone\u2019s smile as they stood before her painting. She let that image settle in. When she opened her eyes, her pencil moved without hesitation, sketching curves and shadows she hadn\u2019t planned moments ago.\n\nBy the time Liis ended her shift, Maris had filled three pages with patterned swirls and bold outlines. Each line felt charged, as if the casino lights themselves were guiding her hand. Packing up, Maris realized that seeing her goal clearly had tuned her inner rhythm. The next morning she\u2019d begin painting in earnest\u2014vibration aligned, vision clear.",
