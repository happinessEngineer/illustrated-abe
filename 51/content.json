    "story": "On a misty morning in Hanoi\u2019s Old Quarter, Linh perched by the open window of her shared apartment, headset resting beside her. She was a telemarketer, practiced at masking irritation with scripted politeness\u2014but today she felt a deeper frustration. Minh, her partner, had left coffee cups scattered across the tiny living room table again.\n\nLinh\u2019s fingers itched to tidy up. She snapped, \u201cMinh, you always make such a mess!\u201d Minh looked up from his sketchpad, surprise in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just sketching ideas for the caf\u00e9 d\u00e9cor,\u201d he said softly. His gentle tone only made her more impatient. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d she shot back. \u201cYou never think of my feelings.\u201d\n\nLater, while walking through the narrow alleyways, Linh replayed the argument. A memory surfaced: she had spent last night worrying aloud about deadlines at work and complaining about city traffic. Weren\u2019t these the same tones she\u2019d used on Minh? Wasn\u2019t her partner only reflecting her own scattered energy?\n\nBy mid-day, Linh sat in a quiet caf\u00e9 near Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake and opened a notebook. She wrote: \u201cMy judgments of Minh mirror my judgments of myself.\u201d She remembered something she\u2019d read about an idea from Abraham-Hicks: your partner is your mirror. If you see resistance in them, it lives in you first. \n\nThat evening, Linh came home with fresh spring rolls and a new resolve. She cleared the cups\u2014a silent apology. When Minh walked in, she smiled, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for snapping. I\u2019ve been tense.\u201d He set aside his sketchpad and pulled her close. \u201cI appreciate you noticing it,\u201d he murmured. \n\nAround them, the soft glow of lanterns reflected in the windowpane. Linh realized that every time she pointed a finger, three pointed back at her. The next morning, as Minh brewed coffee, he asked how her calls had gone. Linh laughed, genuinely relaxed. In the clean, calm kitchen, she felt the truth settle in her heart: when she loved herself, her partner loved her back more fully\u2014and showed her the reflection of her own peace.",
