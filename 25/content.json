    "story": "Mara stepped off the minibus in Waigani Gardens, sunlight glinting on the glass towers of Port Moresby\u2019s National Capital District. She glanced across Ela Beach Bay, her heart fluttering with ambition. For years she\u2019d played small\u2014convinced that financial freedom was reserved for someone else. Somewhere down the line, she\u2019d accepted a scarcity story: there just wasn\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d for her.\n\nAt a community mixer that evening, she met Jason, a broadcast engineer based at the local station near Convention Centre. His face lit up when she mentioned her dream of launching a bespoke arts publication. \u201cI used to think I could only fix wires and set up transmitters,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I shifted my beliefs about what my skills were worth, and suddenly projects\u2014and paychecks\u2014started flowing my way.\u201d\n\nMara\u2019s head buzzed. In her mind she replayed every time she\u2019d doubted her own capacity. Yet listening to Jason\u2019s story felt like a wake-up call. He described how he replaced his outdated inner script\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not enough\u201d\u2014with \u201cI attract abundance naturally.\u201d Soon he upgraded his studio, invested in better gear, and landed international contracts.\n\nThe next morning, Mara walked into the open market where vendors sold saksak and laplap. She closed her eyes and breathed in the salty air. Replaying Jason\u2019s words, she issued a silent affirmation: This publication is a success. Money flows to me effortlessly. She jotted down five reasons why she deserved it\u2014quality content, local insight, passion for her community. The list felt surprisingly solid.\n\nWeek by week, Mara noticed subtle shifts. She felt lighter closing deals with printers in Boroko. She hesitated less when quoting rates to advertisers in Korobosea. Doors that once slammed in her face now opened. When she finally signed a three-month sponsorship agreement with a Port Moresby caf\u00e9 chain, she barely recognized her own excitement.\n\nMonths later, when Mara and Jason shared dinner at Ela Beach Lodge, she raised her glass. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t magic,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cIt was believing I was worthy of abundance.\u201d Jason nodded. \u201cWe all create our reality with the stories we tell ourselves.\u201d And under a canopy of stars, they celebrated how a shift in belief had transformed not just their bank balances, but their very lives.",
