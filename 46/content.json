    "story": "Janine closed her eyes and guided Mark into a gentle trance. They sat in a quiet corner of a caf\u00e9 overlooking the canal, the low hum of Birmingham\u2019s lunchtime bustle just beyond the window. Janine was a hypnotherapist in her fifties, and Mark, a friend from a local writers\u2019 circle, had been wrestling with the idea that money always slipped through his fingers. Lisa, another mutual friend, sipped her tea nearby, ready to cheer on every breakthrough.\n\n\u201cFor so long,\u201d Mark murmured, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t deserve abundance. Every time something good happens, I push it away.\u201d\n\nJanine\u2019s voice was soft. \u201cLet\u2019s find the root. Picture the belief that you\u2019re unworthy of wealth. Notice how it feels in your body.\u201d\n\nUnder her calm direction, Mark visualized a heavy knot in his chest dissolving into warm light. Lisa watched, catching the hopeful glow spreading across his face. Janine coached him to replace each old thought\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t afford that,\u201d \u201cRich people are greedy\u201d\u2014with simply, \u201cI\u2019m open to receiving good.\u201d\n\nWhen Mark opened his eyes, he looked lighter. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this clear about money before.\u201d He felt his shoulders drop, as if he\u2019d been carrying a hidden load all these years.\n\nOver the next week, Mark practiced Janine\u2019s breathing exercise whenever old doubts crept in. He wrote down three things he liked about his current finances each morning. Lisa noticed he walked taller, as though each step carried less resistance.\n\nBy Friday, an unexpected freelance project landed in his inbox: a local magazine needed feature articles on revitalized neighbourhoods. The pay was more than he\u2019d ever charged. Mark paused before accepting, then laughed\u2014half in disbelief, half in joy\u2014and clicked \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nThat evening, the three friends met at a canal-side pub near the Jewellery Quarter. Mark raised his glass. \u201cTo letting go and letting wealth flow,\u201d he toasted.\n\nLisa cheered. Janine smiled, proud that releasing resistance had opened Mark\u2019s door to abundance\u2014not through force, but by simply allowing himself to receive.",
