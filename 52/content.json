    "story": "Javier stepped onto the grassy slope below the Telef\u00e9riQo cable car station, the crisp mountain air of Pichincha filling his lungs. As a telecommunications engineer, he was accustomed to connecting antennas and fiber-optic cables, yet he\u2019d never felt such a powerful signal as the one humming through his own chest.\n\nMarisol joined him, her silver-streaked hair catching the morning sun. She had come seeking relief from a restless mind\u2014an ache for purpose that no workshop or seminar could soothe. Together they watched the dome of Quito spread below, its tiled rooftops shimmering like a circuit board.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been chasing inspiration everywhere,\u201d Marisol confessed. \u201cBooks, retreats, conversations. But I still feel alone.\u201d  \n\nJavier smiled, recalling a teaching he\u2019d once dismissed in youthful impatience. \u201cAbraham-Hicks talks about Source. They say we can\u2019t be separated from it, no matter how lost we feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does one feel a presence you can\u2019t see?\u201d Marisol asked, folding her arms against a sudden breeze.\n\nBefore he could answer, Lucio arrived, his calm energy matching the mountain\u2019s pace. He was neither technician nor academic, but his intuition was as precise as any piece of equipment. \u201cWe\u2019re the receivers,\u201d Lucio said, stepping close. \u201cYou\u2019ve wired your thoughts to interference. Imagine instead that our inner being is a direct channel to Source\u2014pure, alive, always on.\u201d\n\nJavier felt a thrill at the idea. He reached out and touched a wildflower growing between rocks. Its scent\u2014earthy, sweet\u2014seemed to speak in a language he understood. Suddenly, he perceived the truth: he was never separate from that boundless intelligence. It thrummed in every cell, in every breeze, in the distant roar of Quito\u2019s traffic.\n\nMarisol closed her eyes. The tension eased from her shoulders as she listened to the flower\u2019s whisper, the volcanic stones\u2019 steady heartbeat. Lucio placed a hand over her heart. \u201cThe signal is here,\u201d he said. \u201cNot miles below or high above. It\u2019s right where you stand.\u201d\n\nUnder Pichincha\u2019s watch, they stood three, intimately connected\u2014to each other and to Source. In that still moment on the mountainside, separation fell away, and they remembered what they had always known.",
