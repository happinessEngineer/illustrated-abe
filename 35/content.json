    "story": "Julia\u2019s nail studio sat on a narrow side street not far from Stephansdom. Every afternoon, a warm light spilled through the curtained windows onto her polished worktable. As a manicurist who had welcomed clients for decades, she knew how to read more than cuticles\u2014she read emotions.  \n\nOne chilly morning, Michael hurried in. He closed the door with a sigh, shrugging off his wool scarf. Julia sensed tension in his shoulders before he said a word. She offered him a seat and started wrapping his hands in a soothing soak.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling stuck,\u201d Michael admitted. \u201cEverything seems heavy\u2014work, family, even a walk through the park feels like a chore.\u201d  \n\nJulia dipped a brush into pale rose polish and began. \u201cYour feelings are your guidance system,\u201d she said gently. \u201cThey point you toward what lifts you and away from what drags you down.\u201d  \n\nMichael frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that, but how do I follow it?\u201d  \n\n\u201cNotice the difference,\u201d Julia replied, painting a delicate petal on his thumbnail. \u201cWhen you wake up, ask yourself, What feels good in this moment? If the answer is clouded, try something small: a stroll at the Naschmarkt, a cup of chestnut coffee, a moment of quiet before your day begins.\u201d  \n\nHe glanced at her calm expression, realizing that she was describing more than nail art. He began to breathe easier.  \n\nLater, he wandered through the market stalls. At first he felt the same heaviness. Then the aroma of roasting nuts sparked a flicker of pleasure. He paused, filling his lungs with sweet warmth. He watched a vendor peel chestnuts, smiling at the simple act.  \n\nThat evening, Michael called Julia. \u201cI took your advice,\u201d he said, excitement in his voice. \u201cI noticed joy\u2014just for a moment. It felt like a signpost.\u201d  \n\nJulia closed her tray of tools and smiled. \u201cYou listened to your guidance system. Each time you do, you\u2019re one step closer to feeling more like yourself.\u201d  \n\nIn that quiet salon, beneath the soft glow of the Viennese afternoon, Michael realized that every emotion, pleasant or not, was a compass needle pointing him toward greater alignment and peace.",
