    "story": "Dara stepped off his motorbike at the mouth of the Phnom Penh Customs office, tucking neatly the folders he\u2019d carried across the border that morning. Each shipment told a different story: textiles from Siem Reap, spices from Battambang, fresh mango crates bound for downtown markets. He loved the work, the precision, the quiet pride of keeping things moving. But at home, his partner Sokha had begun to feel invisible. She missed his warm smile when he walked through the door, the gentle \u201chello\u201d she used to hear every evening.\n\nThat week, Sokha sat by the banks of the Tonle Sap River in the golden hour, watching boats drift beneath the Royal Palace\u2019s silhouette. In her bag she held a small stack of handwritten cards. On each card she described something she appreciated about Dara: his steady focus on doing what\u2019s right, the kindness he showed to nervous travelers, the playful way he teased her into dancing when they visited the night market. She slipped a card into his jacket pocket before he left for work, leaving another on his pillow.\n\nAt first, Dara noticed the cards only in passing. One morning, as he sorted papers under the ceiling fan\u2019s hum, he unfolded a creased note: \u201cYour honesty makes me feel safe.\u201d He paused. For the first time in weeks, he let the words sink in. He remembered Sokha\u2019s laughter in their tiny balcony garden, the way her eyes lit up when she shared a new poem. Appreciation began to shift something in him\u2014he felt lighter, more present.\n\nThat evening they met at the riverside promenade. Lanterns flickered on boats gliding by. Dara reached for Sokha\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about your words,\u201d he said, voice soft. \u201cI never knew how much hearing your gratitude would mean.\u201d Sokha smiled, brushing a stray lock of hair from his forehead. \u201cYou do so much good in your work. I just wanted you to see it through my eyes.\u201d\n\nAs they watched the water reflect Phnom Penh\u2019s lights, a gentle energy flowed between them. In that moment of mutual recognition, appreciation had woven a new thread through their love. What felt like small cards became a bridge, transforming their relationship into something richer, deeper, and even more alive.",
