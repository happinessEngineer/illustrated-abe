    "story": "Angela Martinez, a 35-year-old Project Manager at a bustling tech startup in Santa Monica, leans back in her kitchen chair one Tuesday evening and watches her seven-year-old daughter, Mia, fidget with crayons at the little table by the window. Mia is starting second grade next week at a new school in Echo Park, and tonight she\u2019s worrying about making friends. As a parent, Angela feels the tug of anxiety too\u2014but she remembers something she recently learned from Abraham-Hicks: \u201cTrust their natural well-being.\u201d\n\nAcross from her sits Daniel Carter, Angela\u2019s husband and a 36-year-old architect, quietly sipping his green tea. He smiles at Angela. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cshe always figures things out.\u201d Angela takes a slow breath and nods. Instead of jumping in with solutions\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey, you\u2019ll be fine\u201d\u2014she gently asks Mia, \u201cWhat\u2019s one exciting thing you\u2019d like about your new classroom?\u201d Mia\u2019s eyes brighten as she imagines a bright yellow reading corner and group art projects.\n\nOver the next few days, Angela practices focusing on her daughter\u2019s natural resilience rather than her fears. On the drive to school, she chats with Mia about her favorite storybooks and reminds herself that life inherently supports well-being. She lets go of the urge to control every detail\u2014the seating chart, recess buddy assignments, lunch menu\u2014and simply affirms, \u201cI trust that you\u2019re guided toward friends who love having you around.\u201d\n\nOn Mia\u2019s first morning, the little girl bounds off the bus with a grin that stretches ear to ear. She\u2019s made two new pals already\u2014one who loves dinosaurs as much as she does, another who shares her passion for mermaids. At the dinner table, Mia excitedly sketches a plan for tomorrow\u2019s art project. Angela catches Daniel\u2019s eye, and they share a satisfied glance. By trusting their daughter\u2019s natural well-being\u2014and releasing the need to micromanage\u2014they\u2019ve watched her thrive exactly as she was meant to."
