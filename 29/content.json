    "story": "Oksana paused at the window of their apartment overlooking the cobbled lane in Podil. The spring breeze carried faint laughter from street performers below. Her husband, an auditor at a local firm, was at the kitchen table, sorting receipts by date. For a moment, she remembered how his careful attention to detail once made her proud\u2014how his excitable smile would break through his serious fa\u00e7ade whenever he spotted a tiny error that spelled big savings for their clients.  \n\nEarlier that morning, they\u2019d bumped into an old friend who teased them about their \u201cquiet routine.\u201d Instead of bristling, Oksana decided to practice the Abraham-Hicks principle she\u2019d read about: focus on what you love about him. She watched him lift his head, pushing a lock of silvered hair behind his ear, and her heart softened.  \n\nShe carried two cups of coffee over. \u201cI noticed you fixed that misprinted invoice yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always catch what everyone else misses.\u201d He grinned, that familiar warmth lighting his eyes. He placed the ledger aside and took a sip.  \n\n\u201cThanks for seeing that,\u201d he replied. Then, quietly: \u201cI\u2019ve been so buried in numbers, I forget how much you appreciate my work.\u201d  \n\nOksana sat down and reached for his hand. \u201cI appreciate your patience, too, when I forget to tell you my plans until the last minute.\u201d The auditor squeezed her fingers, a small gesture that felt like sunrise.  \n\nAn hour later, they strolled along the river embankment. He pointed out a fallen cherry blossom petal drifting on the Dnipro. She laughed at his gentle fascination with such a tiny thing. He laughed back at her joy in simple moments.  \n\nBy dusk, they stopped at a caf\u00e9, watching city lights shimmer on the water. Oksana said, \u201cFocusing on what I love about you makes everything feel lighter.\u201d He nodded, his gaze soft. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do the same for you.\u201d  \n\nUnder Kyiv\u2019s evening glow, they walked home hand in hand, hearts open, reminded that love blooms when we tune in to the good.",
