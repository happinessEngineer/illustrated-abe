    "story": "On a damp morning in Glasgow, two old friends met under the glass canopy of the city\u2019s botanical conservatory. Morag, the botanist who had spent decades coaxing orchids to bloom, pointed out a rare slipper plant she\u2019d propagated from a single seed. Across from her, Anna\u2014once a primary-school teacher\u2014watched the petals unfurl as though she were marveling at first light.\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d retired,\u201d Anna said, her voice soft with wonder. \u201cBut here I am, learning again.\u201d\n\nMorag smiled. \u201cRetirement is just a word. There are no limits to what you can create, Anna. We\u2019re proof.\u201d\n\nNot far off, James emerged from an arch of ferns. He\u2019d spent half a lifetime designing turbines; these days he applied those same problem-solving skills to greenhouse climate-control systems. He carried a battered leather satchel full of sketches and notes.\n\n\u201cYou should see how this new airflow vent will keep temperature stable through the foggy nights,\u201d James said, setting his plans on a nearby bench. \u201cNo more wilted begonias.\u201d\n\nAnna ran her hand along the cool glass. \u201cWe could start a community garden, invite young volunteers to learn from Morag\u2019s methods and James\u2019s engineering tweaks. I could teach them the science behind it\u2014math, biology, language arts. All in one place.\u201d\n\nMorag tapped a slender finger on the saucer beside her slipper plant. \u201cWhy not offer online workshops, too? People all over the world could join, no matter their background.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s perfect,\u201d Anna agreed. \u201cThey\u2019ll see that even in later chapters, they can launch something brand-new.\u201d\n\nBy afternoon, the three sketched a plan on recycled paper: an urban oasis with classes, webinars, and seasonal fairs by the Clyde. They envisioned seedlings arriving by post, instructional videos filmed in the conservatory, and a network of kindred spirits growing passion alongside plants.\n\nAs drizzle tapped the glass above them, Morag closed her notebook. \u201cAge isn\u2019t a boundary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the experience you bring. We are unlimited creators\u2014our careers keep blossoming as long as we choose to water them.\u201d\n\nAnna and James nodded, their hearts warmed by purpose. In the heart of Glasgow, their new venture took root under that glass roof\u2014proof that creativity knows no bounds.",
