    "story": "Lan leaned against the smooth marble wall of her high-rise office in Ho Chi Minh City, scrolling through resumes. As Human Resources Manager, she prided herself on precision and professionalism. Yet today her thoughts buzzed with worry: budgets were tight, headcount freezes loomed, and she wasn\u2019t sure how she could protect her team.  \n\nThat evening, over iced coffee on the sidewalk caf\u00e9-lined Nguyen Hue Boulevard, she met Minh, a friend who taught yoga retreats in the Mekong Delta. Minh wore his calm like a cloak. \u201cWhat if,\u201d he asked, \u201cyou tuned into what you want instead of what you fear?\u201d  \n\nLan glanced at the city lights reflecting in the Saigon River. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what vibration I\u2019m sending. I just feel stuck.\u201d  \n\nMinh smiled. \u201cEvery thought has a frequency. The universe responds instantly. You\u2019re broadcasting uncertainty right now.\u201d  \n\nLan frowned. \u201cHow do I change that?\u201d  \n\nHe guided her through a simple exercise: close her eyes, breathe deeply, and imagine a successful outcome\u2014her team feeling appreciated, goals met, her managers congratulating her on a thriving culture. Just five minutes.  \n\nShe did as he instructed. At first, her mind darted back to the worst-case scenarios\u2014budget cuts, disgruntled staff. But slowly she pictured her department celebrating a record employee engagement score, the CEO pausing her in the hallway to say, \u201cGreat work.\u201d  \n\nThe next morning, Lan arrived at the office with a different energy\u2014lighter, expectant. She barely sat at her desk when her phone buzzed. An email from the CEO popped up: \u201cYour proposal looks solid. Let\u2019s discuss rolling out a pilot next week.\u201d  \n\nShe stared at the screen in disbelief. Just hours earlier, her vibration had been heavy with doubt. Now, in response to her new broadcast of enthusiasm and confidence, the universe had answered instantly.  \n\nThat afternoon, Lan found Minh at the same caf\u00e9. She beamed. \u201cYou were right. I sent a new vibe\u2014and the universe replied right away.\u201d  \n\nMinh toasted his glass. \u201cWelcome to the art of allowing.\u201d  \n\nAnd as motorbikes drifted past and the sky glowed pink over Saigon, Lan realized that her experience was only the beginning of countless instant responses to her vibration.",
