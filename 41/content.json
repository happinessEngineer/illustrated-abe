    "story": "Thandi stepped off the minibus at the edge of Table Mountain\u2019s shadow, Lila tucked against her chest in a bright green sling. As the Recycling Coordinator for her community centre in Khayelitsha, she was used to schedules: pick-up routes, volunteer rosters, even school-yard cleanups. But motherhood felt different\u2014more mysterious.\n\nHer friend Kayla greeted them by the playground gate, cradling a cup of rooibos tea. Kayla had taught drama workshops for children and often spoke of \u201ctrusting life\u2019s flow.\u201d Today she quoted something she\u2019d heard at an online gathering of well-being coaches: \u201cTrust their natural well-being.\u201d\n\nThandi frowned. \u201cI\u2019m worried Lila isn\u2019t eating enough these days. And her naps are all over the place. I\u2019ve tried routines, charts\u2014even a timer. But she fights it.\u201d\n\nKayla smiled, settling onto a bench. \u201cWhat if you let go of plans for a while? Watch what she needs, rather than telling her what to do. That\u2019s the Abraham-Hicks idea: you trust that every being moves toward health if you allow the impulse.\u201d\n\nThandi sat, heart fluttering. She\u2019d designed recycling bins in three colours; she could organize a shift of twenty volunteers without a hitch. But this little girl? It felt impossible.\n\nAcross the grass, Lila toddled toward the swings, pausing to inspect a fallen protea blossom. Thandi held her breath. Kayla whispered, \u201cSee? She\u2019s exploring. Trust that curiosity\u2014she\u2019ll find her way.\u201d\n\nSlowly, Thandi unclenched her jaw. She watched Lila taste blade by blade of grass, squeal when a bird darted overhead, then toddle back for a hug. No routine, no chart\u2014just rhythm.\n\nOver the next week, Thandi stopped glancing at the timer on her phone. She let Lila drift into sleep when she was ready. At mealtimes, she set a few simple options on a tray and stepped aside. Each time, Lila surprised her\u2014sampling peas one day, then reaching eagerly for avocado the next.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Thandi gathered volunteers for a community cleanup at Clifton Beach. Lila ran free in the sand, collecting shells. In letting go, Thandi realized: her daughter\u2019s well-being was unfolding naturally. All she needed was trust. And in that trust, both mother and child found their safest, happiest rhythm.",
