    "story": "Amara stepped out of the dispatch centre in Wuse, shaking off the tension of six straight hours coordinating emergency calls. The afternoon heat of Abuja\u2019s bustle felt like a reminder of all the errands still waiting\u2014groceries, school fees, even a leaky faucet at home. Her friend Chika met her at a corner caf\u00e9 near Jabi Lake, carrying two iced hibiscus teas. \n\n\u201cYou look exhausted,\u201d Chika said, offering a sympathetic smile. She worked in project management and often felt weighed down by deadlines and budgets. Over the years, both women had teased each other about hitting \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d territory\u2014long careers, responsibilities piling up\u2014but today the jokes felt hollow. \n\nAmara exhaled. \u201cI used to think this was normal. Stress equals productivity. But every day I wake up feeling like I\u2019m swimming against the tide.\u201d  \n\nChika stirred her tea. \u201cI\u2019ve been there too. Last week I missed my son\u2019s recital because I couldn\u2019t tear myself from a numbers report. Is this really how we\u2019re supposed to live?\u201d  \n\nAs they spoke, a street musician set up a small talking drum just outside the caf\u00e9. He began a gentle rhythm and offered a quiet blessing: \u201cLife is here to flow, not to strain.\u201d Both women paused, surprised by the wisdom coming from such unexpected lips.  \n\n\u201cFlow,\u201d Amara repeated. The word resonated deep in her chest.  \n\nThat evening, back at the dispatch centre, she decided to experiment. Instead of diving immediately into her backlog, she took five minutes of conscious breathing and set a clear intention: \u201cThis work can be easy.\u201d When the next urgent call came, she remembered the musician\u2019s words. She spoke calmly, guided the ambulance crew with clarity, and discovered problems smoothing out faster than ever. \n\nBy week\u2019s end, Chika reported similar small miracles: a delayed shipment rerouted effortlessly, a team conflict resolving over tea. Both women realized they\u2019d been treating life as a struggle when, in fact, a simple shift in thought made everything lighter. \n\nAmara smiled as she hung up her dispatcher headset: she wasn\u2019t here to struggle. She was here to enjoy the ride.",
