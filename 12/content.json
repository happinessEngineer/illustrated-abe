    "story": "In a sunlit caf\u00e9 overlooking Tallinn\u2019s Old Town rooftops, Dr. Liisa Tamm\u2014recently retired physician\u2014sipped chamomile tea with two longtime friends, Mart and Pille. All three hovered around their late sixties, and each had faced financial tight spots after stepping away from full-time work. Today, though, the mood was light.\n\nMart pushed his cup aside and grinned. \u201cI sold my lakeside summer cottage last month\u2014and you should have seen the joy on my face when the bank transfer hit my account.\u201d He leaned back. \u201cYou know, for thirty years I called myself \u2018the cautious saver.\u2019 But then I read about this Abraham-Hicks idea: \u2018Allow yourself to receive.\u2019 I realized I\u2019d been blocking good things by worrying I didn\u2019t deserve them.\u201d\n\nPille, formerly an accountant, nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve always been the one tracking every kroon and eurocent, terrified of spending more than necessary. But when I planted the thought that I deserved abundance\u2014truly allowed it to flow\u2014I started noticing little windfalls: a cashback refund, an unexpected gift from a nephew. Each one became proof I could trust receiving.\u201d\n\nLiisa, who\u2019d spent her career caring for patients more than herself, felt her heart flutter. \u201cI\u2019ve always given so much\u2014my time, my energy\u2014and yet I hesitated at the thought of treating myself. Last week, I booked a weekend retreat in Haapsalu. I felt guilty at first, like I didn\u2019t earn that pleasure.\u201d She paused, stirring her tea. \u201cBut then I remembered what you two said: \u2018If you give love, care, expertise\u2014you must allow yourself to receive the same.\u2019\u201d \n\nThat evening, as Liisa walked through the cobbled streets toward her apartment in Harju County, she realized something profound. She could extend her own nurturing spirit inward. By opening to receive\u2014be it a kind word, financial ease, or peaceful leisure\u2014she wasn\u2019t being selfish. She was completing the circle of energy she had spent a lifetime passing along. \n\nAnd in that moment, the soft glow of the streetlamps seemed to wink at her, as if the universe itself were cheering: \u201cYes, Doctor, you are worthy. Allow yourself to receive.\u201d",
