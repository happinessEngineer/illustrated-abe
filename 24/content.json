    "story": "Jessa navigated through the humid evening traffic of Quezon City, her headset crackling as calls pinged in rapid succession. As a dispatcher at the city\u2019s busiest EMS center, she prided herself on meeting every demand without fail. Tonight, though, the weight of \u201cwhat if I\u2019m not enough\u201d pressed on her chest.\n\nShe slipped into Sol\u2019s corner caf\u00e9 in Cubao, where her friend Miguel was already sipping a warm brew. Miguel, a project coordinator at a startup in Ortigas, looked up with a reassuring grin.\n\n\u201cLong day?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOverwhelming,\u201d Jessa admitted, unhooking her headset. \u201cWhen I miss a window or can\u2019t arrange an ambulance fast enough, I feel like I\u2019ve let everyone down. I worry my job hinges entirely on perfection.\u201d\n\nMiguel leaned forward. \u201cI get that. I used to think my worth as a coordinator was measured by every deliverable I hit. But I\u2019ve been reading about this idea\u2014that our value is inherent, not earned.\u201d\n\nJessa frowned. \u201cInherent? You mean I\u2019m valuable even when things go sideways?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d he said, stirring his coffee. \u201cThink of a flower. It doesn\u2019t have to perform to deserve sunlight. Its value\u2014to bees, to gardens\u2014is part of its essence. You\u2019re like that flower, Jessa. Your care, your calm voice on frantic calls, your unwavering presence\u2014they\u2019re all expressions of who you are, not bonuses you earn.\u201d\n\nShe listened as cars honked outside and the caf\u00e9\u2019s soft lights glowed. The dispatcher in her wanted proof\u2014statistics, metrics. But a deeper part of her softened.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Miguel continued, \u201cwhen another emergency call comes, you\u2019ll show up prepared. But remind yourself first: you\u2019re more than the tasks you complete.\u201d\n\nJessa tucked her hair behind her ear. \u201cI think I needed to hear that. I\u2019ve forgotten that my value isn\u2019t tied to response times or perfect logistics.\u201d\n\nMiguel raised his mug. \u201cTo knowing our worth before the work begins.\u201d\n\nJessa clinked her mug against his. In that simple toast, she felt a shift: her value, like the lanterns dotting Manila\u2019s night sky, glowed within\u2014steady, inherent, and free of conditions.",
