    "story": "In a quiet corner of Chengdu, three friends in their early thirties gathered at a riverside teahouse. Mei, who raised horses on her small farm outside the city, looked unsettled. Across from her sat Chen, a digital artist whose passion was painting Sichuan\u2019s misty mountains, and Ling, the gentle owner of the nearby tea shop.  \n\nMei set down her cup of jasmine tea with a sigh. \u201cMy new foals aren\u2019t thriving,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve been waking before dawn to track their every move, measuring feed, adjusting stables. Nothing seems to work.\u201d  \n\nChen smiled, stirring his oolong. \u201cI remember when my designs felt forced. I\u2019d stay up all night tweaking pixels until my eyes burned. Then a mentor told me: \u2018Ease is a sign of alignment.\u2019 The moment I let go of micromanaging every brushstroke, the ideas flowed.\u201d  \n\nLing nodded, pouring another round. \u201cIn tea, it\u2019s the same. If you wrestle with the leaves\u2014oversteep, overheat\u2014you lose the flavor. But when you steep them gently, they open on their own.\u201d  \n\nMei\u2019s shoulders relaxed for the first time that afternoon. \u201cBut how do I translate that to horses?\u201d  \n\nThe next morning, Mei walked into her paddock differently. Instead of tallying charts, she whispered good mornings to each horse and released them into the pasture without her usual rigid routine. She stood to one side, simply breathing the cool Sichuan air among bamboo groves.  \n\nWithin minutes, the foals approached her of their own accord. Their glossy coats caught sunlight as they nudged her hands, curious and calm. Mei felt a current of relief pass through her\u2014no more pushing, no more tension. The horses were responding to her quiet presence.  \n\nThat evening, back at the teahouse, Mei beamed. \u201cI realized that when I tried too hard, I\u2019d blocked their natural rhythm. Today, I flowed with them\u2014and everything changed.\u201d  \n\nChen raised his cup. \u201cHere\u2019s to alignment.\u201d  \n\nLing grinned. \u201cAnd to ease\u2014our clearest sign we\u2019re in harmony with life.\u201d  \n\nThey clinked porcelain cups under lantern light, each savoring the simple truth that when life flows with ease, you\u2019re right where you belong.",
