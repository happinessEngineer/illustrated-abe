    "story": "In the cool morning light of Thimphu, Tashi sat at her desk in a quiet corner of the National Library. As the city stirred, she arranged proof pages for a textbook\u2014her familiar routine as a copy editor. For years she\u2019d prided herself on catching every misplaced comma and ensuring each sentence shone with clarity. Yet a small, persistent pulse in her chest yearned for something more.\n\nAcross town, Pema brewed butter tea in her modest home. Once a dedicated schoolteacher, she found joy in guiding young minds. Lately, though, she had begun jotting down travel sketches of Bhutan\u2019s hidden trails\u2014fields of buckwheat, fluttering prayer flags, and birds alighting on rhododendron branches. She longed to share those images beyond the margins of her battered sketchbook.\n\nOne afternoon, Tashi joined Pema for tea. As they chatted, Pema unfolded a pencil rendering of Trashigang Dzong against a pink dawn. Tashi\u2019s heart leaped. \u201cYou capture spirit in every line,\u201d she breathed. Pema blushed. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved drawing, but after decades teaching, I hesitated to call it \u2018work.\u2019\u201d  \n\nTashi tapped her pencil against her notebook. \u201cEditing is my gift,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut my true passion has been watercolor\u2014and I\u2019m tired of shelving my paints.\u201d Pema smiled. \u201cWhy wait any longer?\u201d  \n\nThat very week, they transformed Tashi\u2019s tiny living room into an impromptu studio. Tashi guided Pema on layout and composition, while Pema encouraged Tashi to mix bold mountain hues she\u2019d never dared use. Soon, they invited friends to join weekend classes beneath paper lanterns. Word spread: a retired consultant brought treasured photographs of Laya for sketching; a local shopkeeper contributed handmade paper.\n\nMonths later, the first exhibition of their collaborative work filled a gallery near Clock Tower Square. Locals and tourists murmured in delight at Tashi\u2019s fluid brushstrokes and Pema\u2019s delicate lines. At opening night, Tashi realized that by following her passion\u2014and by lifting Pema to follow hers\u2014they had rewritten their careers not for others\u2019 approval, but for the pure joy of creation. In the heart of Thimphu, two lifelong friends discovered that it is never too late to let passion chart your course.",
