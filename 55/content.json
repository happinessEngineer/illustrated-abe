    "story": "On a bright spring morning in Zagreb, Dr. Ana stepped out of her allergist clinic onto Ilica Street, inhaling the sweet scent of blossoming chestnuts. She had spent the day helping a young mother find relief from persistent hay fever, and yet a faint ripple of tension lingered in her shoulders. Somewhere between patient charts and lab reports, she had forgotten the simple truth she often shared: All is well.\n\nRounding the corner toward the caf\u00e9 where she was to meet her friends Josip and Mia, Ana took a slow breath and repeated to herself, \u201cAll is well.\u201d The phrase felt like warm sunlight through her chest. By the time she reached the little sidewalk table, her shoulders had softened.\n\nJosip waved from beneath his wide-brimmed hat. He\u2019d been wrestling with a stalled design for weeks. Across from him, Mia stirred her espresso with a furrowed brow\u2014she was frustrated about a delayed gallery exhibition. Both wore the look of people carrying invisible suitcases packed tight with worry.\n\nAna smiled. \u201cTell me,\u201d she said, wrapping her hands around her coffee cup, \u201cwhat if everything you\u2019re facing right now is guiding you toward something even better than you can imagine?\u201d\n\nJosip sighed. \u201cEasy to say, but my mind keeps looping on what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nMia nodded. \u201cAnd I keep feeling like I\u2019ve missed my window.\u201d\n\nAna placed her cup on the table and looked at their faces, lit by midmorning light. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s real is what you choose to believe. Every moment is a chance to pivot back to well-being. The Universe isn\u2019t pushing against you. It\u2019s always supporting you.\u201d\n\nThey sat in thoughtful silence. A gentle breeze carried the laughter of children from a nearby park. The sun warmed their skins. Without quite knowing why, Josip relaxed his jaw, and Mia let her shoulders drop.\n\nLater, as they strolled across the square, a street musician struck a joyful chord on his violin. Ana closed her eyes and whispered, \u201cAll is well,\u201d feeling the truth of it resonate in each note.\n\nIn that simple turning toward peace, they all remembered: whenever we choose that vibration of ease, life shifts in harmony. And truly, beneath the surface of every worry, all is well.",
