    "story": "Under the soft glow of early morning light, Carla sat at a wrought-iron table overlooking a quiet arm of the Grand Canal. Her espresso steamed beside her laptop, where she managed social media accounts for an art gallery. Across from her, Marco twirled a silver mustache as he sketched gondolas drifting by, and Lucia watched with a thoughtful smile, her knitting basket full of half-finished scarves.\n\nJust days before, all three had been fretting over shrinking pensions, rising prices, and the uncertainty of tourist seasons. Carla caught herself scrolling through headlines about economic downturns. Marco muttered, \u201cI wish I had more commissions,\u201d and Lucia sighed, \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s never enough to go around.\u201d\n\nBut today, something had shifted. Carla closed her laptop and said, \u201cLet\u2019s try this: instead of focusing on what we lack, let\u2019s focus on what we already have.\u201d She flipped through photos on her phone\u2014glowing reviews from gallery visitors, a heartwarming message from a grateful customer in Tokyo, even a brief shout-out from a popular travel blog. \u201cThese are all pockets of abundance,\u201d she noted.\n\nMarco set aside his sketchpad. \u201cI\u2019ve got years of experience as a boat builder. My hands still remember every curve of wood. That\u2019s something.\u201d He reached for a fresh piece of paper and began drawing ideas for decorative oar handles, imagining an Italian boutique that might commission them.\n\nLucia gently untangled her yarn. \u201cMy classes at the community center are always full. Every week, I teach weaving and color theory. I could host a small textile workshop for visitors.\u201d She glanced at the canal\u2019s reflections, as if seeing endless threads of possibility.\n\nAs the sun climbed higher, the trio made plans: Marco would propose his decorative oars online, Carla would craft a targeted social campaign, and Lucia would pilot her weaving workshop. They weren\u2019t chasing miracles, just redirecting their thoughts from lack to the richness already present in their skills, connections, and creativity.\n\nBy midday, the atmosphere at the canal\u2019s edge felt lighter. Abundance, Carla realized, begins in the mind. And with that shared focus, so many more opportunities seemed ready to set sail.",
