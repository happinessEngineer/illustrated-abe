    "story": "In the dappled morning light of Race Course Park in Lahore, seventy-year-old Ahmed\u2014who\u2019s been selling kulfi and falooda from his little cart for two decades\u2014rests on a low bench. His hands, shaped by years of scooping ice cream for laughing children, now tremble slightly as he sips sweet chai. At sixty-three, Ahmed wonders if he\u2019s lost his spark. \u201cBusiness slows down,\u201d he tells himself. \u201cMaybe I should hang up my scoop.\u201d\n\nMoments later, his friend Zainab, also sixty-three and newly retired after thirty years teaching at a nearby school, settles beside him. She notices the cloud of worry in his eyes. Across the path, sixty-three-year-old Rashid\u2014a gardener whose roses have brightened countless weddings\u2014tends a small bed of marigolds. Zainab calls him over.\n\nAs warm air carries the scent of jasmines, Ahmed admits, \u201cI feel so\u2026 off track lately. None of my regular customers come by, and I\u2019ve started doubting every decision.\u201d\n\nZainab smiles and reaches for his hand. \u201cAhmed, listen to something I learned: You are never \u2018off track.\u2019 Every feeling you have is just a signal pointing you toward what you really want. Even when you doubt, you\u2019re still moving forward. Your desire for a bustling cart is alive in your heart, and that desire cannot be lost.\u201d\n\nRashid kneels to adjust a budding blossom and adds, \u201cWhen my roses wilted last spring, I thought it was over. Then I changed my care routine\u2014shifted my focus just a little\u2014and they came back more vibrant than before. The same life force runs through your kulfi cart, Ahmed. Trust that it\u2019s never too late to bloom again.\u201d\n\nEncouraged, Ahmed closes his eyes and remembers why he began selling ice cream: the simple joy on a child\u2019s face as they sample a cool spoonful. He breathes in the sweetness of chai, the scent of flowers, the laughter of park-goers. In that moment, he feels the familiar spark of possibility. It\u2019s not about forcing success; it\u2019s about tuning his thoughts to that place of hopeful expectation.\n\nWhen he returns to his cart an hour later, Ahmed arranges his colorful kulfi molds with renewed care. A young family approaches, drawn by the tinkling bell on his cart. As he scoops a rosy-pink falooda, he thinks, \u201cI was never off track. Every step brought me exactly here.\u201d And as the delighted children dive into their treats, so does Ahmed\u2014into the sweet unfolding of what comes next.",
