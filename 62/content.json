    "story": "Early one Saturday morning in Addis Ababa, Mariam ducked into a quiet caf\u00e9 just off Bole Road. As a Public Relations Specialist juggling campaign deadlines, she often felt the pressure to prove herself. Today, though, she had made a different choice: to start her weekend by seeking what truly made her feel good.\n\nInside, she found Alem weaving patterns on a carved wooden box. He paused and smiled. \u201cCome sit,\u201d he said, sliding a steaming cup of spiced coffee toward her. Across the table, Selam was unfolding a sketchpad full of cityscapes\u2014towering jacaranda trees, bustling markets, and the scattered sunrise over Entoto Mountains.\n\nMariam inhaled the rich aroma and sank into her chair. \u201cI need your help,\u201d she confessed. \u201cLately, I\u2019m so focused on hitting targets that I forget why I do what I do.\u201d\n\nSelam dipped her pen in ink. \u201cRemind me why you chose PR,\u201d she asked.\n\nMariam closed her eyes. \u201cI love connecting people with stories that uplift them,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cBut somewhere I started chasing perfection instead of joy.\u201d\n\nAlem nodded. \u201cWe all drift. But Abraham-Hicks teaches that our purpose is to feel good. Everything else flows from that. When you\u2019re joyfully sharing someone\u2019s story, the right clients and ideas follow.\u201d\n\nSelam flipped her sketchpad around. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. On the page, a figure danced beneath lantern-lit streets. \u201cThis is you remembering wonder. What if you built your week around moments that light you up, even in your busiest days?\u201d\n\nMariam pictured herself drafting press releases in a sunlit courtyard instead of a crowded office, or sketching ideas on a veranda before client calls. She felt a spark. \u201cI\u2019ll start tomorrow,\u201d she promised. \u201cI\u2019ll pick three little things\u2014listening to live jazz on my walk home, cooking injera with spices I haven\u2019t tried, sketching sunrise scenes\u2014and let those guide my agenda.\u201d\n\nThey cheered with their coffee cups. In that warm caf\u00e9, the three friends made a simple pact: to honor what felt good first, trusting that business success and life vision would follow. As Mariam stepped out into the city\u2019s morning bustle, she smiled. Already, she felt freer, aligned with the single, powerful purpose of choosing joy.",
