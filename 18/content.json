    "story": "On a bright spring morning in Montreal\u2019s Plateau neighbourhood, Marc locked up his small insurance office and strode down the cobblestone street to meet Claire at their favourite caf\u00e9. Though both had long since left the bustle of raising children behind, today they were on grandparent duty: their spirited granddaughter, Sophie, was visiting for the week.\n\nClaire sipped her latte, smiling as Marc recounted Sophie\u2019s worries the night before. \u201cShe fretted she\u2019d never learn to ride her bicycle without training wheels,\u201d he said. \u201cShe almost talked herself out of trying at all.\u201d\n\nClaire\u2014once a high-school teacher\u2014leaned forward. \u201cYou remember what we always believed, don\u2019t you? That beneath every doubt, she carries her own guidance.\u201d\n\nMarc, the insurance agent who spent mornings reassuring clients about life\u2019s uncertainties, nodded. \u201cEasy to say for my clients. Harder when it\u2019s your own kin.\u201d\n\nThey arrived at the park where Sophie waited, eyes wide beneath her oversized helmet. She looked uncertain. Marc felt the familiar tug of wanting to step in, hold the seat, steady the handlebars. Claire put a gentle hand on his arm. \u201cTrust her natural well-being,\u201d she whispered. \u201cShe knows how to find her balance.\u201d\n\nTogether they walked a few paces behind as Sophie pushed off. At first her legs wobbled, her breath quickened. Marc\u2019s heart thumped; Claire\u2019s voice inside him urged calm. He unclenched his fists. Let her be. Let her learn.\n\nMoments later Sophie\u2019s wheels steadied. Her face split into a joyous grin as she rode toward them, hair flying. Marc applauded, and Sophie skidded to a perfect stop. Claire beamed. \u201cSee? She knew what to do all along.\u201d\n\nThat evening, over homemade pea soup in their Montreal condo, Marc reflected on the day. As an insurance agent he was trained to anticipate every worst-case scenario. But as a grandfather\u2014guided by the simple truth Claire taught him\u2014he felt a deeper assurance: that every child, when given loving space, trusts their own innate well-being. And today, Sophie had proven it.",
