    "story": "Amina wiped her leather apron clean and surveyed the narrow lane of Old Dhaka at dawn. At thirty-six, she\u2019d been a cobbler here for more than a decade\u2014resoling shoes, patching sandals, coaxing worn leather back to life. Lately, however, her heart felt heavy. Business was slow. Each morning she counted empty chairs more than grateful customers, and her worry grew.\n\nLate one afternoon, Rahim stopped by. Also thirty-six, he sold vegetables from a handcart a few blocks away. Rahim\u2019s bright stalls of eggplants, okra, and spinach usually drew a steady crowd, yet over the past month his profits had dipped, too.\n\n\u201cI was reading something,\u201d Rahim began, leaning on Amina\u2019s worktable. \u201cAbout this Abraham-Hicks idea: focus on what you have\u2014abundance\u2014rather than what you lack.\u201d\n\nAmina sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been so busy counting my losses I forgot to be grateful for what still arrives.\u201d\n\nRahim smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s try something tomorrow. Before your first customer, list three small things you appreciate.\u201d\n\nThat night, Amina lay awake and thought: I\u2019m grateful for my steady hands, for the morning sun streaking across the Hindu Street, for the old leather scraps I can turn into coin. She jotted them on a scrap of paper.\n\nThe next morning, she read the list aloud. As she did, she noticed a new rhythm in the rhythm of her hammer striking sole. A ragged pair of school shoes arrived first\u2014a small repair but paid promptly. Then a salesman from the neighboring alley came looking for a quick fix. By midday her bench had three pairs lined up, awaiting her care.\n\nRahim, too, tried the exercise. He listed the chatter of his regular customers, the bright green leaves in his baskets, the steady hum of Dhaka streets. He found himself greeting each morning with a lightness he hadn\u2019t felt in weeks\u2014and sales crept back.\n\nA week later, they met again in front of Amina\u2019s stall. Both were smiling more easily now. Amina held up a freshly mended pair of leather chappals. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it works,\u201d she said, \u201cbut when I notice my blessings\u2014even small ones\u2014the next customer seems to appear.\u201d  \n\nRahim nodded. \u201cAbundance creates more abundance. Our markets, our skills, our simple joys\u2014when we focus on them, lack loses its power.\u201d\n\nThat evening, Amina sipped tea with Farhana, her friend and thirty-six-year-old seamstress. Farhana was intrigued and joined their morning ritual. Soon, each quietly celebrated her own version of plenty: the thrum of her sewing machine, friendly neighbors who dropped by, the promise of a new sunrise.\n\nIn the midst of Dhaka\u2019s bustling lanes, three friends learned to shift their gaze from empty chairs and quiet carts to the wealth already around them. With each grateful thought, they discovered new customers, new opportunities\u2014and most of all, a sense of ease in their hearts. They had tapped into abundance, and abundance, it seemed, was eager to join their daily walk.",
