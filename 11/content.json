    "story": "Mateo paused at the top of the scaffolding, clipboard in hand, and looked out over the pastel rooftops of eastern Caracas. As a building inspector, he\u2019d spent years ensuring every beam and bolt met code. Today, though, he felt a familiar knot of tension in his stomach\u2014deadlines, safety concerns, neighbor complaints. He closed his eyes and whispered, \u201cLife is supposed to be fun,\u201d a phrase he\u2019d recently heard in an Abraham-Hicks recording. \n\nDown below, Laura waved up at him. A yoga instructor in El Hatillo, she radiated calm energy even before the sun had fully risen. And nearby, Carlos, his cousin, was adjusting his camera strap\u2014he was a graphic designer capturing urban street art for a new portfolio. Mateo called out, \u201cI need a minute.\u201d \n\nMoments later, they met by a mango tree in the yard of the building under inspection. Laura led them through three gentle breaths. \u201cFeel the warmth of the morning sun,\u201d she coached. \u201cInvite joy into your body.\u201d Carlos let out a theatrical sigh of relief as he snapped a photo of the amber light spilling through mango leaves. \n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Carlos said, \u201cI came here stressed about my next gallery pitch. But I remembered something you told me: focus on what feels good in the moment.\u201d Mateo smiled. \u201cExactly. If we align with joy first, the right solutions follow naturally.\u201d \n\nThey spent the next hour exploring the partially renovated corridors, but they walked slowly now\u2014stopping to admire a hand-painted tile, to taste a fresh mango, to laugh about a half-finished mural shaped like a llama. Mateo tapped his clipboard only when he felt inspired, jotting down notes in colorful inks. \n\nBy midday, the inspection was complete\u2014no rushed calculations or anxious corrections. Instead, everything fell into place: cables neatly tucked, water pipes perfectly aligned, walls stronger than before. As they gathered their things, Laura tucked a scrap of bright fabric into Mateo\u2019s hand. \n\n\u201cNever forget,\u201d she said softly, \u201clife is supposed to be fun.\u201d \n\nMateo tucked that fabric into his clipboard, and as he descended the scaffolding, he felt lighter than he had in years\u2014confident that a joyful heart makes every task an act of creation.",
