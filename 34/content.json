    "story": "On a crisp spring morning in Antwerp, Sofie stepped onto the terrace of her apartment overlooking the Scheldt. She waited for Pieter, her longtime partner, to join her with two steaming cups of koffie. Pieter, a meticulous biostatistician, balanced precise formulas for his next research paper even while pouring milk into their cups. Sofie, who taught children at a nearby school, hummed a cheerful tune as she arranged fresh tulips in a vase.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Sofie said, sipping her coffee. \u201cI love how you always get the foam just right.\u201d\n\nPieter smiled, adjusting his glasses. \u201cYou prefer more cream; I like a lighter touch.\u201d He reached across the table and squeezed her hand. \u201cWe\u2019re different, but I think that\u2019s our strength.\u201d\n\nSofie nodded slowly. She remembered the days when she tried to persuade Pieter to enjoy spontaneous weekend trips, the way she did. He, in turn, once urged her to track their expenses in a spreadsheet. Each had craved the other\u2019s way of living\u2014and felt frustrated when it didn\u2019t match.\n\nThat afternoon, they walked along the cobblestone streets toward the Museum aan de Stroom. Along the way, they passed Annelies, Sofie\u2019s childhood friend, who waved enthusiastically. Annelies was reorganizing her art studio and delighted in chaos: paint splatters on the floor, canvases stacked in haphazard piles.\n\n\u201cHow do you stand it?\u201d Sofie joked. \u201cI\u2019d lose half my paintings.\u201d\n\nAnnelies laughed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t; I\u2019d just see them from different angles! Pieter, you could create formulas to map the splatter patterns.\u201d\n\nPieter chuckled. \u201cMaybe. But I\u2019m happy you embrace your mess.\u201d\n\nAs the three friends admired the river\u2019s glittering surface, Sofie realized how allowing differences had deepened her love for Pieter\u2014and strengthened her bond with Annelies. She leaned into Pieter. \u201cYou and I\u2014we\u2019re like two sides of a coin. Different designs, same shape.\u201d\n\nPieter nodded, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. \u201cExactly. And when we honor that, our relationship becomes richer.\u201d\n\nSofie smiled, heart full. In that moment, she felt gratitude for every contrast\u2014celebrating the unique melodies each person brought into her life.",
