    "story": "Jonas Jensen wiped sweat from his brow as he finished sealing a crack in a building\u2019s foundation. At fifty-one, he\u2019d been Copenhagen\u2019s go-to pest control technician for two decades, yet he still hesitated when setting his fees. He often muttered, \u201cI hope they can afford me,\u201d then charged less than his work was worth.\n\nThat afternoon, over steaming cups of strong coffee at a caf\u00e9 overlooking one of Copenhagen\u2019s quiet canals, Jonas met his old classmate, Anna S\u00f8rensen\u2014also fifty-one and now a financial coach. Anna had heard about his habit of undercharging. Gently, she leaned forward and said, \u201cJonas, you\u2019re giving incredible value. If you can\u2019t receive the full payment, you block the universe from sending more your way. Allow yourself to receive.\u201d\n\nJonas frowned. \u201cBut asking for more feels\u2026 greedy.\u201d\n\nAnna smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking from anyone. You\u2019re simply letting abundance flow through you. A client\u2019s willingness to pay what you deserve is a gift\u2014not just to you, but to them. It lets them honor your skill.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Jonas arrived at a townhouse in \u00d8sterbro. When the homeowner asked for his rate, he paused\u2014remembering Anna\u2019s words\u2014and stated his full price. The homeowner nodded without hesitation and even added, \u201cI\u2019ve heard great things about you. Here\u2019s a little extra for the weekend.\u201d Jonas felt a warm glow as he accepted the envelope.\n\nThat evening, counting the day\u2019s earnings, Jonas realized something had shifted. By allowing himself to receive, he\u2019d stopped trading in self-doubt and opened the door to genuine financial ease. His heart swelled with gratitude as he understood: receiving was simply another beautiful form of giving back."
