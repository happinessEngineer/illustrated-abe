    "story": "Asha stepped off the tram in downtown Abu Dhabi, her laptop bag bouncing gently against her hip. She worked as a Data Entry Clerk at a small finance firm, arriving home each evening to the giggles of her two-year-old daughter, Zara. Tonight, though, she wasn\u2019t rushing back to spreadsheets. She had promised Zara a playdate at the seaside apartment she shared with her close friend Lina, a freelance photographer.\n\nLina greeted them at the door. Fresh mint tea warmed on the table. \u201cZara has been telling me about your sand-painting idea all week,\u201d she said, smiling. Asha unpacked a basket of colored sands, tiny jars of bright blues, pinks, and gold. \u201cI want to watch her pour and mix,\u201d Asha whispered to Lina. \u201cShe\u2019s discovering what makes her happiest.\u201d\n\nThey spread a soft mat on the balcony floor overlooking the Corniche. Zara, eyes wide, reached for a jar of turquoise sand, letting the grains trickle between her chubby fingers. Asha sat close, but didn\u2019t hover. She offered encouragement instead of instruction. \u201cWhat happens if you blend blue and gold?\u201d she asked, voice warm. When Zara tipped the jars too quickly and the colors muddied, Asha simply laughed softly. \u201cSometimes surprises are the best part,\u201d she said, brushing sand off the little one\u2019s palms.\n\nLina clicked her camera quietly, capturing the moment\u2014Zara\u2019s surprised grin, the swirl of colors, Asha\u2019s supportive smile. She knew the principle well: support their joy. In her work, Lina saw how children shine when given room to explore without criticism.\n\nAs dusk settled, Zara clapped with delight, finger-painted trousers and all. Asha swept her into a hug. \u201cYou did that,\u201d she said, pride shining in her eyes. Lina handed them both rosewater biscuits and tea, joining in their laughter. \n\nLater, as the city lights shimmered on the water, the two friends reflected on the evening. By simply stepping back, by cheering Zara on instead of pointing out mistakes, they\u2019d witnessed pure delight. In Abu Dhabi\u2019s gentle breeze, they celebrated a simple truth: children flourish most when we support their joy.",
