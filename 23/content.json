    "story": "Kinshasa stirred to life beneath a golden sunrise, its streets humming with promise. On a quiet corner near the Congo River, Adama, a skilled plasterer with years of steady work under his belt, mixed fresh lime in an aged wooden tub. He tapped his foot to a distant rumba beat, humming along. Neighbors often paused to greet him, drawn by his upbeat energy. He never took it for granted: he knew that the warmth in his tone, the steady smile, and the hopeful rhythm in his day invited others to linger.\n\nLater that morning, Adama wandered into a bustling courtyard caf\u00e9 to collect his customary strong coffee. As he passed, Sefu\u2014who covered local life for a Kinshasa magazine\u2014looked up from her notebook. She noticed how everyone in earshot mirrored Adama\u2019s easy laugh and relaxed posture. Curious, she introduced herself. Over chipped china cups, they discovered a shared love of community art projects. Sefu admitted that she\u2019d been chasing deadlines and deadlines only to feel more isolated. Adama\u2019s calm confidence felt contagious.\n\nBy afternoon, the two stepped into a shaded market lane where Mamu was arranging cassavas and plantains on woven mats. Mamu\u2019s customers often reported feeling lighter after a quick chat\u2014she had a knack for listening without judgment. Sefu and Adama greeted her warmly, and Mamu beamed. Within moments, the three realized something magical: by simply staying true to the positive tone they each carried, they had magnetized one another.\n\nTogether they decided to launch a small mural project on a faded wall near the riverbank. Adama would handle the plaster base, Sefu would document stories from passersby, and Mamu would provide refreshments from her stall. Word spread quickly. Artists, musicians, curious neighbors\u2014all came forward, drawn by the group\u2019s uplifting spirit. Each new helper picked up the same joyous vibe, and soon vibrant shapes blossomed across old concrete.\n\nWhen the final pigments were set and onlookers applauded, the trio stood back, hearts full. Their shared vibration had woven them into a community, proving that in Kinshasa\u2014just as Abraham-Hicks teaches\u2014you attract people by the energy you emit.",
